### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In 2020 I started publishing some old and interesting code that I had generated since 2008.

My repos are organized in GitHub projects [here  &#9757;](https://github.com/etfovac?tab=projects)

Iâ€™m currently working on improving an old code for [USB HID in C#](https://github.com/etfovac/HID_Utility)
